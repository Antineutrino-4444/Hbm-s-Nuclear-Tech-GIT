## The Good Editionâ„¢
Over the years, there's been plenty of games that I had some issue with, but I have been told that it wasn't because it's the game which had a flaw, but rather it was me who is stupid and wrong and stupid. In an effort to making NTM as good as possible, I have now decided to seek out these parts of games that are guaranteed to be good (I wouldn't know, I'm stupid and wrong) and add them to NTM!

* All mobs now have a damage threshold of 2 hearts. Players however now take 2 hearts extra damage from all sources, even ones that otherwise would not deal any damage (bypasses most armor protection).
* Players now have a 10% chance of taking hard damage, hard damage removes 10% of their max life which cannot be regenerated
* Players now have a constant chance of randomly exploding. There is no way of preventing this and it will just happen no matter what
* The player might find themselves inn a random bullet hell situation in regular intervals
* Anti tank mines now have a 25% chance of spawning per chunk
* Guide books have been removed, read the wiki, dipshit
* RBMKs are now gated behind hardcore mode. RBMKs can still be built and operated, however without hardcore mode, the fuel rods will never deplete, and heat will not propagate between RBMK parts, preventing them from cooling
* Most ammo types are now uncraftable, you will have to make do with the meager amounts you can find in the world
* Hostile mobs will no longer exist on difficulties below hard, effectively only creating two difficulty options, piss easy and ball crushing
* Glyphids no longer have a spawn delay, even on difficulty options where they can't exist. Enjoy the lag!
* Bugs are now near-invincible. Makes every encounter a challenge!
* NEI integration has been removed. Handholding the player is bad, people should be smart enough to figure things out on their own
* More mask men. Random bosses with no spawn condition are cool!
* Servers will now randomly crash
* Beds now have 25 million RAD/s, making them effectively unusable in survival play. You may only respawn at your spawn point or in beds spawned in structures, this is to make you lament every death and give you plenty of time to think about what went wrong as you drag your ass back to your death point or some bullshit
